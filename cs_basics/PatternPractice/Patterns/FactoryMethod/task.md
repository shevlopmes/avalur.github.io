Educational summary of [The Factory Method Pattern Explained and Implemented in Java | Creational Design Patterns | Geekific](https://youtu.be/EdFq_JIThqM):

### **🏭 Factory Method Pattern Overview**
- **🛠️ Creational Design:** Focuses on object creation processes in software design.
- **🔄 Loose Coupling:** Separates object construction from its usage, enhancing flexibility.

### **🍔 Example Application**
- **📦 Code Structure:** Utilizes a base class or interface to standardize and manage products (like different types of burgers).
- **🚀 Dynamic Expansion:** Adapts to changes like adding new products without altering existing code.

### **🔧 Implementation Steps**
- **🔑 Abstracting Creation:** Moves the creation logic to a factory class to follow open-closed and single responsibility principles.
- **💡 Simplifying Code Maintenance:** Encapsulates product creation in a factory, isolating changes to one part of the code.

### **👨‍🍳 Practical Use**
- **🌟 Encapsulation:** Centralizes creation logic in a separate class, simplifying extensions and maintenance.
- **⚙️ Flexibility:** Allows easy integration of new product types without impacting existing client code.
