Educational summary of [The Prototype Pattern Explained and Implemented in Java | Creational Design Patterns | Geekific](https://youtu.be/DcFhITC9v0E):

### **🎭 Prototype Pattern Essentials**
- **🛠️ Creational Flexibility:** Enables cloning objects without dependency on their concrete classes.
- **👥 Cloning Interface:** Introduces an interface for cloning, ensuring that all objects adhere to a standard method of replication.

### **🔧 Practical Implementation**
- **🚗 Car Cloning Example:** Utilizes the pattern to duplicate a car object, highlighting both shallow and deep copying techniques.
- **🔄 Decoupling Creation:** Moves the creation logic to the objects themselves, allowing for flexible and independent object duplication.

### **📑 Advanced Concepts**
- **📋 Prototype Registry:** Discusses a central storage for frequently used prototypes to streamline the cloning process.
- **📈 Efficiency and Optimization:** Focuses on reducing resource usage and initialization time through effective cloning.
