Educational summary of [The Template Method Pattern Explained Implemented in Java | Behavioral Design Patterns | Geekific](https://youtu.be/cGoVDzHvD4A):

### **📐 Template Method Pattern Overview**
- **🛠️ Behavioral Design:** Structures an algorithm into a method, allowing certain steps to be overridden by subclasses without altering the algorithm's framework.
- **🔧 Flexibility in Implementation:** Enables subclasses to modify certain steps of an algorithm while adhering to a defined sequence set by the superclass.

### **🎮 Practical Example**
- **🕹️ Game Loading Sequence:** Uses the pattern to standardize the steps involved in loading a game, such as initializing data, creating objects, and cleaning up, with specific behaviors defined in subclasses.

### **🔨 Implementation Insights**
- **🏗️ Abstract and Concrete Steps:** Combines mandatory and optional steps in a base class with the flexibility for subclasses to provide specific implementations.

### **⚙️ Advanced Application**
- **👨‍💻 Code Reusability and Reduction:** Facilitates the reuse of common logic and reduces code duplication by centralizing shared steps in a superclass.
