Educational summary of [The Memento Pattern Explained and Implemented in Java | Behavioral Design Patterns | Geekific](https://youtu.be/_Q5rXfGuyLQ):

### **📝 Memento Pattern Overview**
- **🛠️ Behavioral Design:** Facilitates saving and restoring an object's state without exposing its internal structure.
- **🔒 Encapsulation Integrity:** Ensures that the object's encapsulation remains intact, protecting private data.

### **🗃️ Practical Example**
- **🖋️ Text Editor Undo Functionality:** Demonstrates using the pattern to implement undo capabilities in a text editor, where each state snapshot is encapsulated in a memento object.

### **🔧 Implementation Insights**
- **🏗️ Originator and Memento Interaction:** The originator class handles state creation and restoration from memento objects, which encapsulate the state data.
