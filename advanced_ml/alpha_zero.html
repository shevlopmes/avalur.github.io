                                <p style="text-align: left">TD-Gammon is a computer backgammon program that uses artificial intelligence
                                    and machine learning techniques to play the game at a highly competitive level.

                                    Developed by Gerald Tesauro from IBM.</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            TD-Gammon uses an algorithm called Temporal Difference (TD) learning.
                            The core idea behind TD learning is that it learns directly
                            from raw experience without any explicit supervisory signal.
                            And firstly, people think that it works because of randomness internally embedded to gammon.

                            TD-Gammon uses a multi-layer feed-forward neural network as its function approximator
                            to generalize from its previous gameplay experience.
                            The input to the network is the raw board position,
                            and the output is a single number representing the program's prediction of the expected outcome.

                            Despite being a program developed for a specific game,
                            TD-Gammon's approach is widely applicable and has greatly influenced many other machine learning projects.
                            It was one of the earliest successful demonstrations of a system that learns to improve
                            its performance from raw experience using neural networks.

                            let's talk a bit about the game of Go.

                            Its structure and rules are not very hard: a 19x19 grid, on which players alternately place
                            black and white chips in the nodes.
                            If a player's chip closes off an area, they "capture" all of its interior.

                            At the end of the game, the player with the most control (area) wins.

                            Due to this, up until 2015, the best Go-playing programs could only reach an amateur level.
                            Some developers claimed that computers would never be able to beat the best human players.
                            However, most AI specialists believed that such a program would be developed,

                                <li>Chess: there are 30–40 possibilities, and lots of them are obviously weak</li>
                                <li>Go: there are about 250 possibilities, and about 100 from them are "reasonable"</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Hard to evaluate current position</li>

                                <li>Chess: one can count pieces material and there are simple heuristics</li>
                                <li>Go: it is really challenging even to understand who wins in the final position</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            There are at least two reasons why Go is hard, one is quantative, the other is qualitative.

                            Go has a much larger branching factor than Chess.

                            The qualitative reason is that it is way more challenging to evaluate the current position in Go.
                            Computers could not understand who is winning in Go. There was even a whole benchmark of
                            different final positions in Go, according to human evaluation. And the task was simply
                            to determine, who won.

                            This is a photo from a Go match in which the legendary Korean player Lee Sedol,
                            one of the best in the world, is playing against an AI-based program, AlphaGo.

                            Before the match, Lee Sedol, in fact being a very modest person,
                            said that he would either win cleanly 5:0,
                            or he might underestimate the strength of the program and somewhere due to a mistake,
                            he would win 4:1.

                            What do you think the result was? The computer won with a score of 4:1.
                            It was so-called "sputnik"-moment for all Asia, when they truly understood that
                            deep learning is huge thing.
